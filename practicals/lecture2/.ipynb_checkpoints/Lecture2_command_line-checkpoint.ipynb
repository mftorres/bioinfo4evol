Using the command line interface, we can navigate through folders by following the branches of the tree, up or down to different levels of the hierarchy.  \n",

For example, `ls -l` will list all items within a folder, printing to screen the [permissions of a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions) (first column from left to right), size of the file (fifth column) and last-modified date. To access the same information in a \"human readable\" format, you can use `ls -lh`. If you want to explore more options for listing (or in general for other commands), you can use `ls --help`.\n",

You can also copy (leaves a copy behind) or move (does not, or replaces one version with another) files across folders. Finally, you can create new folders with `mkdir` and the name of the new folder."
