# Sequencing technologies and file formats {#seqtech}

**Brief description:**
This notebook will walk you through the different sequence file formats generated by different sequencing technologies and methods. You will learn to identify the information encoded in the files and how to perform file manipulations like read subsampling and extaction. We will also go over the SAM/BAM format, CIGAR strings, and SAM/BAM filtering and statistics.

1. Text-based sequence formats
1.1. Sequence formats
1.2. Annotation formats

2. The SAM/BAM file
3. Chromatogram based sequence formats
4. Multiple dimension formats
5. Legacy formats
6. Summary by sequencing technology.
